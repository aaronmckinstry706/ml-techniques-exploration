# ml-techniques-exploration

In an effort to familiarize myself with the various techniques common in machine learning (and in an effort to showcase some Java code), I'll be implementing a few models from scratch. The All models can be trained with, and make predictions on, a single CPU (multi-threading may come later, but for now it'll be single-threaded). As I begin implementing each model, I'll be adding a description of the technique to this document.
